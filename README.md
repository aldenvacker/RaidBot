#### 1. EXE Method
> I know many people might be very doubtful. If you do not trust the EXE run a virus scan on it or put it in https://virustotal.com

The easiest way to use this bot is to go the [releases tab](https://github.com/TechVevo/Server-Nuker/releases) and downloading the latest EXE.
  - Download the EXE and place it in a seperate folder (Name it whatever you want).
  - Now open notepad and enter your bot's token and prefix like this:
    ```
    TOKEN=<your bot's token>
    PREFIX=<your prefix>
    ```
  - Now press `Ctrl+S` (or) give `Save As` and navigate to the folder where you put the EXE.
  - Change the save as type from "Text Document (.txt)" to "All Files".
  - Now for the name, enter `.env` and save it.
  - Open the EXE and enjoy nuking!

#### 2. MANUAL Method
> **Note:** If you are going to follow this method, basic knowledge of coding is required. If you are new/don't want the hassle, then I highly suggest you to follow the above given [EXE Method](https://github.com/TechVevo/Server-Nuker#1-exe-method)!

If you do not trust the EXE (or) if you want to run directly from the source, follow the instructions below. You also need to **satisfy the "[REQUIREMENTS](https://github.com/TechVevo/Server-Nuker#requirements)" given below!** (You do not need those for the EXE)
  - Go to the master branch and click on "Code" and give "Download as ZIP".

  - Extract it and navigate inside the folder. It should look somewhat like this:

  - Open the .env file in NotePad and edit the TOKEN with your bot's token. You can also change the prefix (Default is `.`) if you want.
  - Now open a terminal here or navigate to this folder in cmd.
  - Type in `npm i`. Doing so will install all the necessary dependancies
  - Now type in `node index.js` or `npm start`
  - Once you get the "ready" message that looks something like "<Your Bot> is ready!", you can run `<prefix>help` to get a list of commands.
